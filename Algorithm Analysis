### General Time Complexity Analysis

1. **Training Time Complexity**:
   - Building a single decision tree: (O(m.n log n)), where m is the number of features and n is the number of data points.
   - Building the Random Forest: (O(T.m.n log n)), where T is the number of trees.

2. **Prediction Time Complexity*:
   - Single Decision Tree:(O(h)), where h is the height of the tree. For balanced trees, \(h \approx \log n\).
   - Random Forest: (O(T.log n)).

### Specific Calculations

#### Given Parameters
- Number of trees,T = 30
- Number of features,m = 30
- Number of data points,n= 284,807

#### Training Phase

The time complexity for training the Random Forest is:
O(T.m.n.log n) = O(30.30.284,807.log 284,807)

Approximating (log 284,807):
log^2 284,807 =  18.1


So, the training time complexity is:
O(30.30.284,807.18.1) = O(463,268,761)


#### Prediction Phase

The time complexity for making predictions with the Random Forest is:
O(T.log n) = O(30.log 284,807)

Using the previous approximation:
log^2 284,807=18.1


So, the prediction time complexity for each instance is:
O(30.18.1) = O(543)


### Combining with Best, Worst, and Average Cases

#### Worst-Case Time Complexity

Given:
- k = 100
- n = 57,962

Calculation:

O(100.57,962^2) = O(335,744,624,400)


#### Best-Case Time Complexity

Given:
- n = 57,962

Calculation:
O(57,962.log 57,962)=O(920,586)


#### Average-Case Time Complexity

Given:
- k = 100
- n = 57,962

Calculation:
O(100.57,962log 57,962)= O(92,058,600)


### Final Notes

The general complexities highlight the impact of data size and model parameters on computational costs:

- **Training Phase**: (T.m.nlog n)
- **Prediction Phase**: (O(Tlog n))

Specific calculations for your project indicate substantial computational demands for training, with the worst-case scenario being particularly intensive. The best-case and average-case scenarios provide more moderate but still significant complexities. These analyses underscore the importance of optimizing Random Forest parameters and preprocessing techniques to balance accuracy and efficiency in large-scale applications like fraud detection.
